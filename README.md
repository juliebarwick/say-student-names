# Say Student Names

A program that randomly selects student names from your CSVs and reads them aloud. I wrote this program for use in classes where I needed to call on all students in a fun way.

## Usage
* Fork and/or `git clone` the repo.
* Add your csv files to the csv folder. Suggested format in `example.csv`.
  * Be sure to give the csv files a name that is recognizable for the class.
* Run `main.py` in your local python environment.
